### We love open source!
But for obvious reason we dont want to share all the ins and outs.
But we **do** want you to know how we did it!
This repository servs the purpose of letting the public know how our game was written and to document mine and Björns journey as we become better at what we do.
With this said, cloning this repo does nothing for you in the contextof running the service.
If you would like to play our game locally or have any other suggestions, please don't hesitate to reach out to us and we might just make it happen!

### Current state of this repository
Backend is available for sneak-peeks!
Frontend and Stable Diffusion is on the way.
